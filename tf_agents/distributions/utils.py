  Unlike the normal distribution computed when NormalProjectionNetwork
  is called with scale_distribution=False, which merely squashes the mean
  of the distribution to within the action spec, this distribution scales the
  output distribution to ensure that the output action fits within the spec.

  This distribution also maintains the input normal distribution, and uses this
  distribution to compute the KL-divergence between two SquashToSpecNormal
  distributions provided that they were scaled by the same action spec.
  This is possible as KL divergence is invariant when both distributions are
  transformed using the same invertible function.

  Formally, let a be the action magnitude and b be the action mean. The
  squashing operation performs the following change of variables to the
  input distribution X:

  Y = a * tanh(X) + b

  Note that this is a change of variables as the function is invertible, with:

  X = tan((Y - b) / a), where Y in (b - a, b + a)
